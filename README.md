## Context:
This was originally just built for a school projet, not meant to be a real python library.
However, as i really liked to develop it, it has grown larger than expected.

### Advantages :
Also, I think that this library has some advantages: 
- You can directly retrieve the **pillow image object** : **.Im** (for example to be able to modify it without having to save it locally).
- You can directly retrieve the **numpy array** of the Qr code: **.matrix**
- The **qr.csv** table and the constants **FORMATBITS**, **VERSIONBITS** and **MASKS**, gather all the information necessary to build a Qr code.  So feel free to use it instead of searching the internet for hours as I did.

### Limitations :
As the development is not very advanced, they are limitations to it, including (non-exhaustive):
- Mask 4 seems broken, *should be fixed soon*
- Not all versions have been tested, versions > 10 seems broken, *have to find out where the error comes from*
- The qr code version is not automatically determined, so it must be chosen according to the data length. *This is the very next feature.*
- The mask is not automatically determined.

## How to use:

    #To create a qr which contains 'hello world':
    qr = Qr('hello world',mask=0,forceVersion=1,errorCorrectionLevel='L')
    qr.save(path) #saves the image to the specified path
    qr.Im #The pillow Image of the Qr
    qr.matrix #The numpy array of the Qr
    qr.finalBits #The raw bit strig encoded in the Qr, including error correction


## Current version: v0
This version was realeasd now only because of my school project's deadline. 
**This version is not production ready !**
It lacks several features, and has a few bugs.
Also, there is no real install at the moment, appart from cloning the repo, or dowloading it's archive.


## Roadmap:
### Planned additions:
- Proper error handling
- Auto version determination
- Add scale parameter to the .save() method, to scale up the image.
- .show() method to display the qr, in console or pop-up
- Switch the "version" from dictionary to an object
- Three methods of qr creation, .fromData(), .fromBytes() & .fromArray() to be able to create a qr code from those three datatypes
- Add the other data formats
- Auto mask determination
